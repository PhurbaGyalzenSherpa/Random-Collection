The history of banking in Nepal started in 1937 AD with the establishment of Nepal
Bank Limited as first commercial bank. The growth in the banking sector has drastically
changed the paying habit of people. 

It wasn’t long ago when people only dealt with hard cash. Queuing in banks to withdraw the
smallest amount of money also wasn’t unusual. But today, more and more Nepali people find 
it convenient to carry plastic money in their wallets instead of hard cash.

If we look back into banking history of Nepal, the first credit card in Nepal was introduced 
by Nabil Bank in 1990, and the first ATM was introduced by the Himalayan Bank in 1995.
